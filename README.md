# git-and-pharo
Getting Git and Pharo to play nicely.

## Description
Smalltalk is a great language, but to me it has the characteristic of not playing nice with others outside of its own virtual machine. This is a playground repo for getting experience in using Git with Pharo Smalltalk.

## Resources
This repo is done with guidance from [Peter Uhnak's blog](https://www.peteruhnak.com/blog/2016/07/25/how-to-use-git-and-github-with-pharo/).
